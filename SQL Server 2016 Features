Always Encrypted : Always Encrypted is designed to protect
 data at rest or in motion. With Always Encrypted, 
 SQL Server can perform operations on encrypted data
 and the encryption key can reside with the application. 
 Encryption and decryption of data happens transparently 
 inside the application. This means the data stored in SQL Server
 will be encrypted which can secure it from DBA and administrators 
 but that also has considerations for ad-hoc queries, reporting and exporting the data.
